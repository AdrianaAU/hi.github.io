How I Made This Website!<br>
 <br>Helloo! This is me,Adriana! Today i am going to be telling a story about HOW i first made this website! So basically,my sister had went in a website called udemy.com that my parents told her to do. I asked my parents if i could also go to that! My parents said" Ok! But you have to study!". I was very happy,i went to the iMac and then started the course. I felt amazed just from the introduction! There were so much things to learn! Then everyday i started completing 5 videos and more. I then saw in 21,HTML 5. There was Create your Own Website! I really wanted to get there and now,here i am. Made a website and learning more and more everyday! I want to tell you,You can do the same! Sure,it takes a lot of hard work but it will all pay off! I mean,can you believe i just started like,1 month ago and i'm already creating my own website?! Here is the link if you want to try it out : https://www.udemy.com/ Thanks so much for reading this story,Bye!<br>



A Story About My Dog!<br>
<br>Hi! I'm Adriana,i wanted to tell you a story about Me and My Dog. Lets start! It all started in May 17th. 11 days till my birthday(28th May) My mom said i could have a hamster for my birthday! I wanted to have a pet for so long so i was very happy. Everyday i would ask Google what was the Date and then jump around saying"1 week till my birthday! Im gonna get a hamster!!" Anyways,in May 17th My sister and My Dad went in the car and said they were getting Groceries. But i was a little suspicous cause my sister always doesnt want to go to the mall to get groceries. Then i went  and asked my mom for food. While my Mom was preparing food,i got the TV remote and started watching some YouTube. After a few hours my dad and sister came home. They said they had a surprise for me! I was excited,but i thought that it was some new shoes or anything else than a DOG! Then my dad or my sister took out my dog from the car!I was shocked and was soo happy!!! After a few days of staying with him,i got used to it. Then we decided to pick a name for him cause we couldn't just call him "Nibbles" all around the place! I cried cause,i really liked the name. Then i got over it and then wanted to name him "Chocolate" but my family disagreed! So my mom picked from the internet,the name Hershey. Then we all agreed! So there you have it everybody! A story about my dog! Bye and see YOU in the next story!<br>
